WaterModels.jl Change Log
=========================

### v0.9.0
- Remove MathOptInterface dependency in support of JuMP 0.22.

### v0.8.0
- Remove the convention of defining the _number_ of flow partitioning points for parameterizing linearized formulations.
- Let users define flow partitioning points for head loss and head gain functions using `flow_partition` entries within pipe, design pipe, and pump objects.
- Implement a `set_flow_partitions_si!` function that leverages PolyhedralRelaxations.jl to partition the space of flows for pipes, design pipes, and pumps.
- Implement per-unit conversions for network data and automatically compute per-unit transformations if not provided by the user.
- Add new global keys for per-unit conversion factors.
- Implement `pump_group` component sets that model symmetrical groups of pumps.
- Implement symmetry-breaking constraints for symmetrical groups of pumps.
- Refactor flow direction, pump model, and status enumerated types.
- Implement additional constraints to ensure tank level bounds will be satisfied after an Euler step, beginning from a fixed tank level.
- Implement constraints to model pump on and off switching limits.
- Implement new OWF specification that includes pump switching limits.
- Implement new functions for setting variable warm-start values.
- Implement `apply_wm!`, which wraps the InfrastructureModels `apply!` function.
- Remove scaled pump power variables and use direct power variables in per-unit, instead.
- Correctly distinguish between time _points_ and time _intervals_ used in multinetwork formulations.
- By default, do _not_ convert pipes that are short to short pipes.
- Refactor portions of the optimization-based bound tightening (OBBT) algorithm.
- Allow for usage of OBBT on multinetwork data sets.
- Add helper functions for relaxing select binary variables.

### v0.7.0
