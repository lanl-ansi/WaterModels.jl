## Code Contributions

Community-driven development and enhancement of WaterModels is welcomed and encouraged. Please feel free to fork this repository and share your contributions to the master branch with a pull requests.

That said, it is important to keep in mind the code quality requirements and scope of WaterModels before preparing a contribution.

### WaterModels Scope
The primary motivation for WaterModels is to help researchers quickly and easily replicate established results in water systems optimization. 
More preliminary research and development efforts are best left to other packages, which extend WaterModels.
That said, the WaterModels package should have a software design that makes building such extensions as easy as possible.

### Code Quality Requirements
WaterModels strives to be a user-friendly, highly-reliable, and well-maintained package.
To that end, the following code quality controls are necessary for all contributions:
- All features must have unit tests.
- Naming conventions must be consistent.
- Core features must have documentation.
- Code style must be consistent (e.g. four spaces for indentation).

Due to these quality control requirements, pull requests to WaterModels may require lengthy discussion and code review.
